The output of calculateInferenceScaling is not close (within 4 decimal places) to the python code when presented with the same input - specifically scaled_traces.npy for the python code and scaled_traces.bin (a binary float16 export of the .npy that is loaded in the typescript worker.ts). The computation of the inferenceScaling value should yield to within 4 decimal places to 0.3761194029850746.

Create two stand alone scripts: calculate_inference_scaling.py and calculate_inference_scaling.ts.

First ensure that the .py file calculates the exact value (0.3761194029850746). This same code exists in inference_scaling_to_onnx.py and torch_vs_onnx.ipynb where this value is exactly calculated.

Then create a standalone typescript script that loads the scaled_traces.bin and calculates the inferene scaling factor. Use the current function in worker.ts as a starting point. Where possible avoid conversions of the arrays - specifically converting scaled_traces to 32bit floats vs. keeping it all as float16. Where appropriate use onnx Torch Tensor operations.

> Copilot: I'll help you create two standalone scripts to debug the inference scaling calculation and ensure they match. Let me start by examining the existing code and then create the scripts. Now let me check if we have the scaled_traces data files: Let me also check the validation folder: Now I'll check if there are any notebook files that show the exact computation: Let me check the torch_vs_onnx notebook to see the exact computation: Perfect! Now I have the exact computation from the notebook. I can see that the expected value is `0.3761194029850746` as stated. Let me create the two standalone scripts: Now let me run the Python script to verify it produces the correct value: Perfect! The Python script produces the exact expected value (within 4 decimal places). Now let me create the TypeScript version: Now let me run the TypeScript script to test it: I need to fix the TypeScript module issue. Let me update the script:

@agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

> Copilot: Excellent! The TypeScript script now produces the exact expected value `0.3761194029850746` with zero difference. Both scripts are working correctly.

> 1. **Quantile calculation method**: The original uses simple floor indexing, but PyTorch uses linear interpolation
> 2. **Median calculation method**: The original uses simple middle element, but PyTorch uses proper median calculation for even-length arrays

>
> I've successfully created two standalone scripts and fixed the inference scaling calculation issue:
>
> ### ✅ Created Scripts
>
> 1. **calculate_inference_scaling.py** - Validates the exact PyTorch computation and produces `0.3761194029850746`
> 2. **calculate_inference_scaling.ts** - TypeScript implementation that matches PyTorch exactly and produces `0.3761194029850746`
>
> ### ✅ Fixed Issues
>
> The main problems were:
>
> 1. **Quantile calculation**: The original used simple floor indexing instead of PyTorch's linear interpolation
> 2. **Median calculation**: The original didn't properly handle even-length arrays like PyTorch does
>
> ### ✅ Updated worker.ts
>
> - Replaced the flawed quantile and median calculations with PyTorch-compatible implementations
> - Removed the hardcoded inference scaling override
> - Added helper functions `linearInterpolate()` and `calculateMedian()`
>
> Both standalone scripts now produce the exact expected value `0.3761194029850746`, and the updated worker.ts should now calculate the correct inference scaling value when processing the scaled traces data.

Now add verification to App.vue, after the verification that inferenceScaling matches, that the values in model_outputs.bin match those returned from the worker. For this just verify the first 5 windows (each is 120 frames) match what's in model_outputs.bin to within 3 decimal places. Don't iterate if they don't match, just implement the comparison logic at this point.

> Copilot: I need to first check the current state of the worker.ts file to understand what the user has manually edited, then examine the model_outputs.bin format and add verification to App.vue. Now let me check what format the model_outputs.bin file is in by looking at related files: Let me also check if there's a Python script that shows how the model_outputs.bin was created: Let me see the rest of the export script to understand the format better: Now I understand the format. The model_outputs.bin contains the expected outputs from the detection model, with shape [942, 1200] in float16 format. Each window produces 120 output frames, so the first 5 windows would be the first 600 frames (5 \* 120 = 600).

> Now let me check if there are any errors in the updated App.vue: Perfect! Let me also check the public models directory to make sure the model_outputs.bin file exists: Great! The model_outputs.bin file exists. Let me also verify what format the worker returns its detection outputs in by checking the current worker.ts: Perfect! The worker returns `results.output.data as Float32Array` which is the ONNX output data, and each window produces a Float32Array. My implementation should work correctly.
